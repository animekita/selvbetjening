Selvbetjening (Self Service)
============================

Selvbetjening (danish for self service) is a collection of Django apps for event and member management. These are used by a number of small clubs and medium sized conferences to build event registration applications. Each Selvbetjening installation consist of a mixture of Selvbetjening apps and installation-specific apps - depending on the desired features.

The core principles of Selvbetjening is to provide a common set of required models defining events, user profiles, ect. with a large collection of optional apps such as an admin interface, member and event registration pages, public profiles. The aim is to be flexible, in the sense that each installation can select a specific set of apps they want to use, and build their own.

Changes are welcome if they are necessary in order to support new installations. If you are planning to use this to build your own event registration site then feel free to contact teknik@anime-kita.dk with any support questions (or to let us now you are using it).
